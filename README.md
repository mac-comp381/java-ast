# Java AST printer

Prints a full AST for a Java source file.

Open with either IntelliJ or VS Code (with Java plugin), or use `gradle run` from the command line.

The program will prompt you to open a `.java` file, then print the AST to the console. You can parse the same file repeatedly if you want to experiment with modifications.
